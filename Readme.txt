This directory contains the source code of other open-source projects used by SharpDevelop.
Projects used by SharpDevelop in binary form only are here as compressed archives (might be useful if some project disappears or becomes commercial, e.g. NCover).
Projects used by SharpDevelop in (modified) source form are here in unpacked, unmodified form. This allows merging changes between vendor releases into our modified version.
